# programming-languages-threeAddressCodeParserAndInterpreter
This is a project for the university where there were two tasks described below:
Implement two programs/scripts as a console applications implemented in Python 3.81:
1. task: A parser (parser.py) checks lexical and syntactical correctness of a given source program
in IPPeCode (text-based assembly-like language) and transforms the source code into a XML
representation of the code.
2. task: An interpreter (taci.py) processes the given source program represented as three-address
code (abbrv. 3-AC) instructions stored in XML format (as from the parser) and interprets it.
